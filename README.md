# Reflection Questions:

### 1. How did you design the ID so itâ€™s always the same for the same input?
I have used SHA-256 hashing with canonical input formatting for generating deterministic IDs.

1. **Canonicalization Process:**
   - All string fields (project_name, registry, serial_number) are trimmed and converted to lowercase.
   - Numeric fields (vintage, quantity) are converted to strings.
   - Fields are concatenated with pipe separator: project_name|registry|vintage|quantity|serial_number.

2. **Hashing:**
   - SHA-256 hash is computed from the canonical string.
   - Result is encoded as a 64-character hexadecimal string.

This ensures identical inputs always produce the same ID.

### 2. Why did you use an event log instead of updating the record directly?

The event log provides several benefits for this case:

1. **Immutable Audit Trail:**
   - Complete history of all state changes.
   - Cannot be tampered with or deleted.

2. **Credit Misuse Prevention:**
   - Clear record of when credits were retired.
   - Impossible to "un-retire" credits.

3. **Traceability:**
   - Full lifecycle tracking from creation to retirement.

### 3. If two people tried to retire the same credit at the same time, what would break? How would you fix it?

**What Would Break:**
1. Two retirement events for the same credit.
2. Invalid system state (credit retired twice).

**Solution:**

**Transaction Isolation:**
   - All operations wrapped in database transactions.
   - ACID properties ensure consistency.
   - Rollback on constraint violations.
